 Introduction

This project is a collection of Java implementations for different Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. The goal of this repository is to help you learn, understand, and implement the common data structures and algorithms that form the foundation of computer science and software engineering.

Each folder contains the Java code for a particular DSA concept, and each file in the folder demonstrates different methods, techniques, or problems related to that concept.

 Folders and Topics

 Arrays
The Arrays folder contains implementations for array operations such as searching, sorting, and manipulating arrays.
. `Arrays.java`: Example of array operations like searching and sorting.

 Linked Lists
This folder contains implementations for singly and doubly linked lists, and operations like insertions, deletions, and traversals.
. `LinkedList.java`: Implementation of a singly linked list with insertion, deletion, and traversal.

 Stacks
Stacks follow the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The folder includes basic stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
. `Stacks.java`: Stack implementation using arrays or linked lists.

 Queues
Queues follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The folder contains queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, and peek.
. `Queues.java`: Implementation of a queue using arrays or linked lists.

 Sorting
Sorting is a fundamental operation. This folder contains popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort.
. `Sorting.java`: Implementation of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

 Searching
The Searching folder contains common search algorithms such as Linear Search, Binary Search, and others.
. `Searching.java`: Binary search and linear search implementations.

 Trees
The Trees folder contains the implementation of various tree structures like binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and operations like traversal and insertion.
. `Trees.java`: Implementation of binary trees and binary search trees (BST), including in.order, pre.order, and post.order traversals.

 Graphs
This folder contains implementations for graph data structures and algorithms like depth.first search (DFS), breadth.first search (BFS), and others.
. `Graphs.java`: Implementation of graph traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS.

 Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to optimize recursive algorithms by storing results of subproblems. This folder includes classic DP problems like the Fibonacci series and the 0/1 Knapsack problem.
. `DynamicProgramming.java`: DP solutions for problems like Fibonacci series, 0/1 Knapsack problem.

 Backtracking
Backtracking is a technique used for solving combinatorial problems. This folder contains solutions to problems like the N.Queens problem.
. `Backtracking.java`: Backtracking solution for the N.Queens problem.
